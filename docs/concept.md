## ðŸ§© Core Product Concept
    A smart, wearable device that comprises of
        Quantum biosensor
            Detects venom molecules or venom-induced biomarkers in blood/tissue in real time
        AI-based venom classifier
            Determines venom family (neurotoxic, hemotoxic, cytotoxic) using edge ML
        Auto-injector module
            Delivers the appropriate broad-spectrum antidote (e.g., Varespladib or future antivenom)
        Emergency signal system
            Sends GPS, vital signs, and venom type to local health services instantly

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Concept
### A. Hardware
    Quantum sensor: Use diamond NV centers or quantum dots to detect specific venom proteins or enzyme activity (e.g. PLA2).
    Wearable electronics: Flexible PCB, power-efficient processor (e.g., Nordic nRF or Qualcomm wearables).
    Delivery module: Miniaturized auto-injection or microneedle patch.

### B. Software
    ML venom classifier trained on known venom patterns.
    Real-time diagnostics via embedded AI.
    Mobile app for field use, symptom monitoring, and GPS-based alert system.

### C. Biochemistry
    Stock or partner to include:
        Broad-spectrum small molecule inhibitors (e.g., Varespladib)
        Recombinant nanobody antidotes (modular, mix-n-match)

## How It Works
    Bite occurs
    Biosensor detects venom biomarker
    ML model classifies venom type
    Auto-injector delivers correct antidote
    Sends SOS signal with location and health data

## Product Prototype
    Key features:
        Quantum NV-center sensor
        Antidote cartridge system
        Wireless communications
        Rugged, waterproof design
